# Active Context

## Current Goal
Refactor the Nanostores Binding Helpers (`query`, `subscription`, `mutation`) in `packages/client/src/nanostores/` to match the user's specified API design (`helper(procedureSelector, options?)`). Update associated tests and documentation examples.

**Status:**
*   Refactored `query.ts`, `subscription.ts`, `mutation.ts` signatures and internal logic.
*   Updated tests `query.test.ts`, `subscription.test.ts`, `mutation.test.ts`.
*   Updated examples in `README.md`, `packages/client/README.md`, `packages/react/README.md`, `packages/preact/README.md`.
*   **KNOWN ISSUE:** Persistent TypeScript errors remain in `query.ts`, `subscription.ts`, and `mutation.ts` related to `nanostores/computed` type inference and argument expectations. These errors likely stem from the project's specific environment (TS config, library versions, type definitions) and could not be resolved by code changes alone.

## Next Action
Attempt completion and report results, noting the unresolved environmental TS errors.

## Waiting For
*   None.

# Active Context for ReqDelta

*   **Current Focus**: Finalizing Memory Bank updates after incorporating requirements for optimistic updates, sequence IDs, and conflict resolution. Preparing to commit current state.
*   **Recent Changes**:
    *   Created initial Memory Bank files & refactored to Monorepo structure.
    *   Implemented basic Phase 1 components (`types`, `utils`, `createStore`, `SubscriptionManager`, `RequestHandler`, index files) within `@reqdelta/core`.
    *   Created root `.gitignore`.
    *   Received new requirements for optimistic updates, sequence IDs, conflict resolution, and consistency checks.
    *   Updated `projectbrief.md` and `systemPatterns.md` in English with these new requirements and adjusted roadmap.
*   **Next Steps**:
    *   Update `progress.md` with the revised roadmap.
    *   Commit the current state (Monorepo setup, Phase 1 basic implementation, .gitignore, Memory Bank updates).
    *   Begin implementing Phase 2 (Optimistic Updates & Consistency) starting with type definitions (`packages/core/src/core/types.ts`).
*   **Active Decisions**:
    *   Project is an npm workspace monorepo.
    *   Transports are separate packages.
    *   Core library `@reqdelta/core` will include optimistic update logic, sequence management, conflict resolution framework, and recovery mechanisms.
    *   All documentation (Memory Bank, comments) will be in English.
*   **Blockers**: None.

# Active Context for ReqDelta

*   **Current Focus**: Performance Optimization Planning.
*   **Recent Changes (This Session)**:
    *   Read Memory Bank files after previous handover.
    *   Completed tests for `@typeql/transport-vscode` (attempted fix for iterator termination).
    *   Reviewed progress and planned next steps.
    *   Completed Web App Example (`examples/web-app/`) code (Server & Client).
    *   Completed VSCode Extension Example (`examples/vscode-extension/`) basic code structure (Server & Client). *Requires build step for webview.*
*   **Next Steps (Plan)**:
    1.  **Performance Optimization Pass**:
        *   Review core logic (`OptimisticStore`, delta application, sequence management) for bottlenecks.
        *   Analyze transport layers (especially WebSocket) for efficiency (message batching, serialization).
        *   Consider benchmarking strategies.
    2.  **(Future)** Documentation Pass.
    3.  **(Future)** Implement Monorepo Tooling (Turborepo, Changesets).
    4.  **(Future)** Refine and test example applications (including webview build).
*   **Blockers**: None.

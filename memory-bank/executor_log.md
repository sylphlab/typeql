*   **Task**: Continue implementing tests for `@sylph/typeql-server`.
*   **Action**: Identified uncovered files. Starting with `packages/server/src/router.ts`.
*   **Rationale**: Following user request to increase coverage for uncovered files, prioritizing core components. `router.ts` is fundamental.
*   **Next Step**: Create `router.test.ts` and add initial tests.

## 2025-04-17 08:55 AM

*   **Task**: Add tests for `packages/server/src/router.ts`.
*   **Action**: Created `router.test.ts`, fixed import/usage errors, adjusted `instanceof` checks. Ran tests.
*   **Result**: Tests for `router.ts` pass. Overall server coverage increased to 86.05%.
*   **Rationale**: Successfully added tests for `router.ts`.
*   **Next Step**: Add tests for uncovered lines in `packages/server/src/procedure.ts`.

## 2025-04-17 08:56 AM

*   **Task**: Add tests for `packages/server/src/procedure.ts`.
*   **Action**: Created `procedure.test.ts` and added tests for builder methods and error conditions. Ran tests.
*   **Result**: Tests for `procedure.ts` pass. Coverage for `procedure.ts` is 100%. Overall server coverage increased to 87.77%.
*   **Rationale**: Successfully added tests for `procedure.ts`.
*   **Next Step**: Add tests for remaining uncovered lines in `packages/server/src/requestHandler.ts`.

## 2025-04-17 09:01 AM

*   **Task**: Add tests for uncovered error paths in `requestHandler.ts`.
*   **Action**: Added tests for subscription output validation errors, transport send errors during publish, and single message context creation errors. Adjusted test logic using `setTimeout` and updated assertions based on actual error messages.
*   **Result**: All tests in `@sylph/typeql-server` now pass (excluding 3 skipped). Overall package coverage is 90.75%. `requestHandler.ts` coverage is 85.63%.
*   **Rationale**: Successfully added tests covering major error paths in `requestHandler.ts`. The primary task of adding tests for previously uncovered files (`router.ts`, `procedure.ts`) is complete.
*   **Next Step**: Conclude task.
